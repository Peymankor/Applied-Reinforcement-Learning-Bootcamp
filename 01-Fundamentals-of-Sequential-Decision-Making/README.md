## Learning Objectives

- Understand the fundamental concepts of sequential decision making
- Learn how to formulate problems as Markov Decision Processes
- Develop an understanding of optimization techniques for decision problems
- Build intuition about handling uncertainty in decision processes
- Recognize the trade-offs in different decision making approaches
- Apply sequential decision making principles to real-world problems

## Key Concepts

- States, actions, transitions, and rewards
- Bellman equations and optimality principles
- Planning horizons (finite vs. infinite)
- Deterministic vs. stochastic decision processes
- Recursive optimization techniques
- Decision theoretic planning
- Optimal stopping problems

## Case Studies

The **SDA_Asset_Selling** folder contains a comprehensive case study that demonstrates how to apply sequential decision making principles to the problem of selling assets (such as stocks or real estate) over time to maximize returns. This practical application illustrates the theoretical concepts covered in the main notebooks.
